I'm building a music player that boots off of a Raspberry Pi 3B+ that opens a browser using playwright and plays music from [pianostream](pianostream.com) with a custom GUI audio controls built with the Kivy UI Python UI library. All of this is going to be placed within a 3D printed case that has openings for all ports and the 5 inch touchscreen.

# What I Learned in this Project
- Producing complete software that is used by the client
- Programming using web automation and a new UI library
- Learning how to create 3D models that can be printed and fit with other peripherals.



# Tools Used / Development Environment
- Python
- VS Code
- Terminal
- Windows 10
- Music Site: [pianostream.com](http://pianostream.com/) 
- UI Library: [Kivy.org](https://kivy.org/)
- Web Automation: [playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev/) 





# How to Set Up
- This is optional step you can take before the installation & setup section to help keep the project libraries seperate
  - ***(OPTIONAL)*** Create a virtual environment if you choose to do so
      - In the /pi-music-player folder
      - `python3 -m venv venv`
      - On macOS and Linux `source venv/bin/activate`
  - ***(OPTIONAL)*** Managing the virtual environment
      - When you want to leave use `deactivate`
      - Make sure to upgrade pip `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

- This project was implemented on our local machine inside of a virtual machine using:
  - Clone this repository 
  - Open terminal at the codebase `~.../pi-music-player/`
